      <strong>YOUR OWN RISK</strong>. All market situations and outcomes are to
      be considered hypothetical and are for training/education purposes. You
      fully understand and agree that Matador Trading is engaged in the business
      of providing trader education and demonstrates its training abilities
      through active, live market analysis and demonstrations and posting
      depictions of anticipated market moves and targets in various time frames
      from time to time for its students and potential clients to evaluate the
      possible benefits for future personal use which may be achieved through
      enrolling as a student with Matador Trading and being trained in the
      methods used and taught by Matador Trading to its students. Matador
      Trading strictly prohibits, the use any of the information or market
      related data posted either on the web site or in any of the chat rooms for
      actual live trading by any free member or subscriber. In the event you
      breach this provision, without our knowledge or consent, you assume the
      entire risk and cost of any such trading or investing and you are solely
      responsible for any and all gains and losses, financial, emotional or
      otherwise experienced, suffered or incurred by you. All transactions you
      choose to engage in with or without seeking advice from a licensed and
      qualified financial advisor or entity are conducted at your sole
      discretion and are your sole responsibility. Any information, education,
      opinion, advice, guidance, direction or offer posted by any entity logged
      onto the web site or in any of the chat rooms or the training room is to
      be construed as public conversation only. Matador Trading makes no
      warranties that trading methods or systems presented, discussed, shown or
      taught either on their web site or in any chat room, in the training room
      or over the telephone will result in profits or losses. Matador Trading
      gives no assurances regarding the accuracy, truth, timeliness, reliability
      or good faith of any material or information posted. The information is
      for educational or sales purposes only and is not intended to provide
      trading, investment, tax or legal advice, which you should obtain from
      your professional advisor prior to making any trade or investment of the
      type discussed or posted on the web site, in any of the chat or training
      rooms or over the telephone with one of our admin. The information does
      not constitute a solicitation by Matador Trading, or any other person,
      affiliate or entity for the purchase or sale of any security, commodity,
      bond, futures contract or option of any kind. You understand and agree
      that there is a very high degree of risk involved in any market, trading
      or investing activity and fully understand and accept that people can and
      often do lose money. Past performance results of any individual trades or
      trader published, posted, discussed or taught on the web site or in any of
      the chat rooms or the training room or over the telephone are not
      indicative of future returns using that same method of trading nor by that
      same nor any other trader, including you, in the future and similar
      returns may not be realized by you in the future. Performance results have
      many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No
      representation is being made that any account or individual trader will or
      is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown, described,
      posted, taught or discussed in the chat rooms, training rooms or over the
      telephone. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between
      individual trading results between other traders exposed to the same
      information or posts and the actual trades taught or used as an example in
      the postings or teachings in the chat rooms, the training room or over the
      telephone. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial
      risk and no hypothetical trading can completely account for the impact of
      financial risk in actual trading, for example, the ability to withstand
      losses or adhere to a particular trading methodology, strategy or program
      in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely
      affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to
      the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading
      method, strategy or program which cannot be fully accounted for, all of
      which can adversely affect actual trading results. The methodologies,
      indicators, strategies and all other features of the Matador Trading chat
      and training rooms (hereinafter collectively referred to as the
      “Information”) is provided for informational, educational and
      demonstrational purposes only and should not be construed as investment or
      trading advice. The analysts, instructors, posters and employees or
      affiliates of Matador Trading may or may not hold positions in the
      financial instruments discussed or demonstrated at any given time in the
      chat or training rooms and the trades taught or trading examples given or
      used in the chat or training rooms may or may not be actually being traded
      by Matador Trading or its officers, directors, employees or instructors
      hence, they are to be considered hypothetical trades. You should not rely
      solely on the information taught, posted or discussed in the chat or
      training rooms in making any trade or investment decisions. Rather, you
      should use the information only as an educational guide and as a starting
      point for your learning and understanding of the markets and for
      conducting additional independent research in order to allow you to form
      your own opinion regarding your own trading or investing. THE SERVICE IS
